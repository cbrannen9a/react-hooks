### Example of useState hook with additional function to update state

Initially declare the state value `count` and function to update `setCount` with `count` set to 0.

The `updateCount` function uses the `setCount` function to update the `count` value. The can be used to provide more complex logic to update the `count`. In the case adding 1 to the existing `count`, multiplying by 2 then adding to the `count` value.
